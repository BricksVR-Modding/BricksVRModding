# BricksVRModding
A simple repo that explains the basics, anyone can upload their mods here!

There are 2 main types of modding:
- Clientside
- Serverside

What are they individually useful for?
Clientside can be used for:
- UI objects such as making the menu dark (darkemod)
- Adding a cool FPS counter (AXTL's UI Mod)
- Possibly adding new menus and such!
- And way more

But what is serverside useful for?
Well, serverside is a bit more complex to maaster but when you do:
- Movable bricks as well as new types of bricks!
- Drivable cars?!
- A new way to mess with your friends!
- And again, too much to explain here.

How do we start modding?
