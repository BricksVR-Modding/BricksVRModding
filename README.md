# BricksVRModding
A simple repo that explains the basics, anyone can upload their mods here!

There are 2 main types of modding:
- Clientside
- Serverside

What are they individually useful for?
Clientside can be used for:
- UI objects such as making the menu dark (darkemod)
- Adding a cool FPS counter (AXTL's UI Mod)
- Possibly adding new menus and such!
- And way more

But what is serverside useful for?
Well, serverside is a bit more complex to maaster but when you do:
- Movable bricks as well as new types of bricks!
- Drivable cars?!
- A new way to mess with your friends!
- And again, too much to explain here.

How do we start modding?

Step 1: Download melonloader from https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader and run it.
 - Once you run it, it will ask you to select a MONO (or .exe) application
 - Select BricksVR.exe and hit run / install
 - Once melonloader is done installing you are good to go!

Step 2: In order to begin modding install https://github.com/sinai-dev/UnityExplorer/releases/tag/4.1.10
 - Unity explorer is not necessary for modding, but is a nice QOL application

Step 3: Unzip Unity explorer
 - There should be a file called UnityExplorer.MelonLoader.IL2CPP.zip 
 - Go into said folder and take out the .dll
 - Access the mod folder (Location will vary for alot of people)
 - Once done put the .dll you took out, and drop it into the mods folder.
 
 You are now done! Enjoy modding.
 Any new mods you create will need to be put in the Mods folder.
